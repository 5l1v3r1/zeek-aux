.SH NAME
cf -  unix time to formated time and date filter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cf
[
.B -f fmt
] [
.B -lpsu
] [
.I file ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This filter reads the named files (or from stdin if there are none)
and replaces numeric timestamps found at the beginning of each line
with a formated time and date time and date. For example:
.LP
.RS
.na
.nh
\% echo '1074558944 default format' | cf
.br  
Jan 19 16:35:44 default format
.ad
.hy
.RE

The default format is '%b\ %e\ %H:%M:%S'. The
.B \-l
flag appends the year ('%Y') to the default format. There are two
ways to specify a custom format; one is with the
.B \-f
flag. The other is to set the
.B CFTIMEFMT
environment variable. Finally, using an empty format with the
.B \-f
flag causes
.B cf
to revert to its default format.
Note that the
.B \-f
and
.B \-l
flags override the
.B CFTIMEFMT
environment variable.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-f fmt
Specify a strftime(1) format string. For example:
.LP
.RS
.RS
.na
.nh
% echo '1074558944 custom format' | \\
    cf -f '%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S'

Jan 19 16:35:44 2004 long format
.ad

% echo '1100980501.867105 preserve format' | cf -p
.br  
Nov 20 11:55:01.867105 preserve format

long and contains one or less dots.
