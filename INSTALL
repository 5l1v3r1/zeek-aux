Prerequisites
=============

Bro-aux relies on the following libraries and tools, which need to be installed
before you begin with the installation:

    * Libpcap
       Required to build the 'adtrace' program.

    * Flex
       Flex is already installed on most systems, so with luck you can
       skip having to install it yourself.

    * BIND8 headers and libraries
       These are usually already installed as well.

    * CMake 2.8 or greater
       CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system, typically
       not installed by default.  See http://www.cmake.org for more
       information regarding CMake and the installation steps below for
       how to use it to build this distribution.

Installation
============

To build and install into /usr/local:

    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cmake ..
    > make
    > make install

This will perform an out-of-source build into the build directory using the
default build options and then install binaries into /usr/local/bin

To change the install prefix or other build options, copy the
BuildOptions.cmake file from the top-level source directory into the
build directory and then modify it using a preferred text editor:

    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cp ../BuildOptions.cmake .
    > <edit BuildOptions.cmake>
    > cmake ..
    > make
    > make install
