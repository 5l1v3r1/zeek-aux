Prerequisites
=============

Bro-aux relies on the following libraries and tools, which need to be
installed before you begin:

    * Libpcap headers and libraries
       Network traffic capture library

    * Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer)
       Flex is already installed on most systems, so with luck you can
       skip having to install it yourself.

    * BIND8 headers and libraries
       These are usually already installed as well.

    * OpenSSL headers and libraries
        These are likely installed, though some platforms may require
        installation of a 'devel' package for the headers.

    * CMake 2.8 or greater
       CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system, typically
       not installed by default.  See http://www.cmake.org for more
       information regarding CMake and the installation steps below for
       how to use it to build this distribution.  CMake generates native
       Makefiles that depend on GNU Make by default.

Installation
============

To build and install into /usr/local/bro:

    > ./configure
    > cd build
    > make
    > make install

This will perform an out-of-source build into the build directory using the
default build options and then install binaries into /usr/local/bro/bin.

You can specify a different installation directory with

   > ./configure --prefix=<dir>

Run "./configure --help" for more options.
