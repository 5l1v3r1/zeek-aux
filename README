======================
Bro Auxiliary Programs
======================

Handy auxiliary programs related to the use of the Bro Network Security
Monitor (http://www.bro-ids.org).

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

adtrace
=======

Makefile and source for the adtrace utility. This program is used
in conjunction with the localnetMAC.pl perl script to compute the
network address that compose the internal and extern nets that bro
is monitoring. This program when run by itself just reads a pcap
(tcpcump) file and writes out the src MAC, dst MAC, src IP, dst
IP for each packet seen in the file. This output is processed by
the localnetMAC.pl script during 'make install'.

bdcat
=====

A utility for decrypting encrypted Bro log files.

devel-tools
===========

* extract-conn-by-uid: extracts a connection from a trace file based on its
  UID found in Bro's conn.log
* gen-mozilla-ca-list.rb: generate list of Mozilla SSL root certificates in
  a format readable by Bro.
* update-changes: a script to help manage updates to a repository's CHANGES
  and VERSION files

nftools
=======

Utilities for dealing with Bro's custom file format for storing
NetFlow records.  nfcollector reads NetFlow data from a socket
and writes it in Bro's format.  ftwire2bro reads NetFlow "wire"
format (e.g., as generated by a 'flow-export' directive) and writes
it in Bro's format.

rst
===

Makefile and source for the rst utility. "rst" can be invoked by
a Bro script to terminate an established TCP connection by forging
RST tear-down packets.  See terminate_connection() in conn.bro.

Former Aux. Tools
=================

These programs are now distributed separately:

cf
--

cf reads lines from stdin and if the line begins with a number,
then it assumes that the number corresponds to a Unix timestamp
and replaces it with the corresponding local time in a readable
format.  Useful for running on log files.  See cf/cf.man.txt for
documentation.

Available at ftp://ee.lbl.gov/cf.tar.gz

hf
--

The main utility in this subdirectory is hf, which translates
any dotted-quad (in text) appearing on stdin to the corresponding
DNS hostname (via a PTR lookup) on stdout.

Available at ftp://ee.lbl.gov/hf.tar.gz

create-cert
-----------

A tool to create SSL certificates for secure Bro/Broccoli
communication.

Available at ftp://ee.lbl.gov/create-cert.tar.gz
